# Purpose of this project

The Penny Pinchers Expenses app is designed to allow users to organise, edit, display and delete their expenses, which will help them long term to manage their finances. By just clicking the "Add expense" button and filling out the details a user can add thier costs to a list, later on down the line if they wish to the user can also delete or edit the list or expense. The user also gets a total of their expenses so they can be aware as to the exact number all their expenses come to.

# User Demographic

The user demographic for this expense tracker, or expense trackers in general can be anyone from people collecting pocket money to those that are retired. Everyone who will use an expense tracker has a reason to do so whether thats for saving or just to keep on top of their finances. Some examples of this would be:
- Small business owners tracking business expenses.
- Families looking to see how much their spending. 
- A young person trying to get their finances in order from early on. 

The ultimate goal for these users is for them to gain better control over their finances, track their spending (good and bad) and acheive thier financial end goal. 

# User Experience 

As a user of the app I want to be able to do the following: 
 - Log into my account securely using private authentication credentials. 
 - Have access and view my expenses. 
 - Add, delete and edit any of my expenses. 
 - Ensure that my personal data is private and secure. 

# Agile Methodology 

When developing this app an agile approach has been taken throughout this project. I broke each instance down into smaller User stories so they were refined into more manageable tasks therefore each User story has different acceptance criterias. The link to the kanban board for the User Stories can be found [HERE]. By doing this it has made it easier for me to buld the project.
