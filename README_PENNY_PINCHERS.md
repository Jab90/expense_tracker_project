# Purpose of this project

The Penny Pinchers Expenses app is designed to allow users to organise, edit, display and delete their expenses, which will help them long term to manage their finances. By just clicking the "Add expense" button and filling out the details a user can add thier costs to a list, later on down the line if they wish to the user can also delete or edit the list or expense. The user also gets a total of their expenses so they can be aware as to the exact number all their expenses come to.

The user demographic for this expense tracker, or expense trackers in general can be anyone from people collecting pocket money to those that are retired. Everyone who will use an expense tracker has a reason to do so whether thats for saving or just to keep on top of their finances. Some examples of this would be:
